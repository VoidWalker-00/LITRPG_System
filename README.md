# LITRPG_System

LITRPG_System is a terminal-based tool for building and tracking progression systems in LITRPG-style worlds.
It’s designed for writers and designers who want fine-grained control over how stats, levels, and abilities evolve — and for tracking the growth of individual characters over time.

<br>

## Overview

The app separates system creation (world rules) from character tracking (individual progress).

You can:

Design and save entire system templates — complete rule frameworks for a fictional world.

Create character templates that operate within those systems — tracking their growth, classes, and stats over time.

While you can design multiple systems, progress tracking is character-based.
The system editor defines how things work; the character tracker shows how those rules are applied

# Features

<br>

## System Editor

Build and customize your own LITRPG progression system.
You can create something simple and linear — or as complex as novels like Defiance of the Fall or Randidly Ghosthound.

**System Editor Tools**

**Stats**
Add, remove, and define core stats (e.g., Strength, Agility, Intelligence, etc.).
Configure quantitative growth and qualitative scaling across tiers or levels.

**Levels**
Set experience requirements, growth formulas, or leveling curves.
Define tier boundaries and progression thresholds.

**Classes**
Add or remove classes.
Specify class bonuses per level, class type (e.g., mage, hybrid, combat), and class quality (Common → Origin).
Define how class progression interacts with level tiers.

**Skills**
Add or edit skills that characters can learn or evolve.
Assign stat influences, level growth, and scaling qualities.
Enable progression tracking (e.g., skill XP or proficiency).

**Information Fields**
Add custom data fields such as Name, Title, Location, Status Effects, etc.
These define what the system displays in a character sheet or status window.

## System Templates

Define the rules and structure of your world — the foundation upon which all characters operate.
You can:

Save, load, and reuse different world systems.

Adjust stat behaviors, level formulas, and class hierarchies.

Use them as blueprints for future stories or experiments.

## Character Tracker

Represent individual characters living within a chosen system.
Each character template includes:

Personal stat sheet (current level, tier, stats, etc.)

Skill list and class information

Experience progress and tier stage

Optional notes or narrative entries for story tracking

Note: Only characters can be tracked in real time.
System templates define rules but do not have “progress” themselves.
